#### Introduction

Neural networks excel in tasks like image recognition and optimization, yet their computational demands escalate with higher data dimensions. Quantum computers offer a transformative solution by endowing computations with an exponential advantage in Hilbert Space size. This inherent quantum parallelism holds particular promise for enhancing the capabilities of image recognition models, with Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN) emerging as a compelling avenue for advancing classification performance. In my project, I investigate classical-to-quantum data encoding, comparing conventional angle encoding with a novel amplitude encoding scheme. The focus is on binary MNIST classification, aiming to demonstrate successful classification using both encoding methods and contribute insights to quantum machine learning. My work will include four main parts: **DIY 1D Quantum Classifier**; **2x2 lines classification**; **4x4 lines classification**; and **MNIST Binary Classification** (reference 1).

I used Xanadu's PennyLane Python package for Quantum Machine Learning (2) for model training, and IBM's Qiskit (3) for visualization tools and work with state vectors.
